- To get started, simply hit the play button!
- **The only clickable area on the board will be the top row itself.**
  - This is to prevent the players from being able to cheat and place the chips anywhere they'd like!
- Turns will rotate automatically and dispaly a message based one whose turn it currently is.
- The first player to match up 4 chips in a row, column, or diagonally wins!
- To reset the game board and play again, simply hit the 'reset' button at any point during the game or after a win.
  - The 'reset' button will remain hidden up until the first play is made.
- There is an optional 'sound' button at the top next the the 'dark/light' button.
  - This will be automatically disabled at first.
  - If the user wants to activate the sound, simply press the button once and you're done!
  - To disbale the sound button, just press the button once more and there will be no sound.
